# Process & Steps

## Prerequisites

### Download and Install Python 3

- Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Left click “Download Python 3.X.X”
- Run the installer
- Check the box that says:
“Add Python 3.x to PATH”
- Click “Install Now” (recommended).
- The installer will set up Python and pip (Python’s package manager).
- Once it finishes, you’ll see a “Setup was successful” message.

- To verify Python installed correctly, open your command prompt and type:
“python -–version” or “python3 -–version” , if you see “Python 3.X.X” it was set up successfully.
- For pip, once again in the command prompt, type: “pip -–version” and look for 
a similar response to verify a successfully set up.

### Create a Python Virtual Environment

- Install python3 virtual environment using 
"sudo apt install python3-env"
